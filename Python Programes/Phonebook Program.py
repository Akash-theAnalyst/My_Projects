#Implement the MYPY Phone Book System in Python as per Figure, which allows users to add, delete, update and lookup phone numbers.
#The MYPY Phone Book System should store the individualâ€™s Full Name and Phone Number. Your program should not allow users to add the same number twice.
#On adding, deleting, updating or looking up a number, your program should let the user know if the operation was successful or not.
#On looking up a number return the full name and number of the individual; if the number is not found give the user the option to add the details they are looking up.
#The user can perform multiple actions; they can add a new entry and subsequently delete an entry without having to stop and start the program until they decide to quit.
